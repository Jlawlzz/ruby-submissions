# Goals

#### Begin to Learn Python

##### Status: 
  * I have not begun

##### Success: 
  * I would love to be comfortable in one framework (Django or Tornado) by the end of the year.

##### Resources: 
  * http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/ 
  * http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/                  
  * https://books.google.com/books/about/Learning_Python.html?id=4pgQfXQvekcC&source=kp_cover&hl=en
  * https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-python/
  * https://talkpython.fm/ 
  * https://developers.google.com/edu/python/ 

##### Ideas: 
  * Build out a few old rails projects in Python. The two languages are similar enough it would do alot to highlight the   difference between the two languages.
  * Learn Tornado & Django (Tornado is light and flexible kinda like node.js, Django is heavy and formatted kinda like     Rails)
  * Hopefully get a job in Python out of Turing! I would like to explore python, and the right company could really        foster that (the Uber team I am interviewing for is in Tornado)
  
##### Contributing to Community:
  * Picking the right Python framework for the job.
  * Python: OO or Functional? YOU DECIDE!

##### Why:
  * I would really like to become a technology generalist as time moves foward. Someone who can direct a project towards   particular direction and vision.  An understanding of many different technologies is necessary to be effective at     this, Python seems like a good place to start! (it doesnt hurt that a ton of people are hiring for Python jobs! :p)

#### Begin to Learn Python

##### Status: 
  * I read a good amount of Java through blogs detailing DSP and audio manipulation in general. I really like the         way it reads although the explitedness of it does throw me off.
    
##### Success: 
  *  If I could do all of my DSP work in Java by the end of the year it would be great. Not only is it effecient, Java     is an on the up and up at the moment and is a very practical language to know.

##### Ideas: 
  * Build out the mix-cake value proposition in Java.
  * Build an audio stream site on Java.
  * Build a CRUD app using the lightweight Play! framework: http://www.playframework.org/

##### Contributing to Community:
  * Byte-based vs time-based audio processing. Which and Why?
  * Making the switch from Rails/Javascript to Java (tips and tricks)

##### Why: 
  * I eventually want to move into the audio side of the tech world. As of right now almost every major player bases      their backend off of Java, making it a must know.

#### Create an open source library (npm, or gem), or micro-service that allows users to interact with audio in a unique        and valuable way.

##### Status: 
  * This is the goal I am closest to achieving. I have quite a few projects in progress that are potential canidates      for my first library. Song identification agnostification, Audio recognition, and third party playlisting.

##### Success: 
  * It would be great to have an active userbase around a library I push out.  This includes people submitting pull       requests, issues, and using the library for projects (even one or two projects would make me estathic!).

##### Ideas:
  * Extract the song-id agnostifier from tango-music and build out a library that allows universal access to services      id's for a particular song.
  * keep the backend for mix-cake and build a react-native front-end to allow mobile microphone id tagging of songs.

##### Contributing to Community:
  * The agnostification of dissimalar data sets accross API's and YOU!
  * How can we make the Audio API landscape less restricted without threatening cash-flow?
  * Finding new value from API quilting.

##### Why:
  * Sound is my passion, it is the background I came from and I want to keep it an integral part of what I do. Over the   course of Turing I have had the privilage of working with some awesome open source audio libraries. It would be       awesome to give back and create something that a Turing folk after me can utilize!
